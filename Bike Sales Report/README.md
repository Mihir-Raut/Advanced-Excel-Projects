# Interactive Sales Data Dashboard

## Project Overview

Within this project, I meticulously developed an interactive dashboard report using Microsoft Excel for an in-depth sales data analysis centered around a bike store.

## Visualizations

The project featured essential visualizations:

### Clustered Column Chart

Designed to discern the average customer income, based on gender and bike purchase history.

### Line Chart 1

Created to visualize customer commute distances, revealing insightful travel patterns.

### Line Chart 2

Highlighting age brackets of bike-purchasing customers, providing valuable demographic insights.

## Key Insights

### Insight 1: Gender Influence

Notably, male customers displayed a higher propensity for bike purchases when compared to their female counterparts.

### Insight 2: Commuting Patterns

Primary bike purchasers primarily resided within a commute distance of 0-2 miles from their residence to the workplace.

### Insight 3: Age Dynamics

The analysis revealed that middle-aged individuals exhibited the highest likelihood of purchasing bikes, surpassing both younger and older age groups.

This project exemplifies my proficiency in data analysis and dashboard creation, empowering businesses with actionable insights derived from empirical data.
